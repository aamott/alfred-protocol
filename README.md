## Creating a Skill
All skills are stored in the `skills-repository` folder. To make a new skill, create a folder inside the `skills-repository` folder and add a file named `init.py` or give it the same name as your folder. As an example, look at the depiction below. 
```
alfred-protocol
â”œâ”€ skills_repository
    â”œâ”€ your_skill
    â”‚  â”œâ”€ your_skill.py
    â”œâ”€ your_other_skill
        â”œâ”€ init.py
```

All skills should inherit from the `Skills` class. _Check out the example skill, `hello world` for more details._ 
``` py
from skills_repository.alfred_skill import AlfredSkill

# Your skill class
class HelloWorld(AlfredSkill):
    name = "Hello World"
    phrases = ["hello", "hello world"]

    def __init__(self):
        AlfredSkill.__init__(self)
        self.name = "Hello World"

    def run_skill(phrase):
        print("hello world!")

# AlfredProtocol will call create_skill to create the skill. 
# It should register an instance of your skill, like shown.
def register_skill(skill_register_func):
    skill = HelloWorld()
    skill_register_func(skill, skill.phrases)

```
