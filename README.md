## Creating a Skill
All skills are stored in the `skills-repository` folder. To make a new skill, create a folder inside the `skills-repository` folder and add a file named `init.py` or give it the same name as your folder. As an example, look at the depiction below. 
```
alfred-protocol
â”œâ”€ skills_repository
    â”œâ”€ your_skill
    â”‚  â”œâ”€ your_skill.py
    â”œâ”€ your_other_skill
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€ your_single_file_skill.py
```

All skills should inherit from the `AlfredSkill` class. _Check out the example skill, `hello world` for more details._ 
``` py
from skills_repository.alfred_skill import AlfredSkill

class HelloWorld(AlfredSkill):
    name="Hello World"
    
    def __init__(self):
        AlfredSkill.__init__(self)

    def initialize_intents(self, register_intent):
        """
        registers intents to AlfredProtocol

        Receives: a reference to AlfredProtocol's intent register function
        """
        register_intent(self.handle_say_hello, ["hello", "hello world"], self.name)

    
    def handle_say_hello(phrase):
        print("hello world!")

# Returns an instance of your skill
def create_skill():
    skill_instance =  HelloWorld()
    return skill_instance
```

# To-Do
- [ ] Add more skills!
- [ ] Find a way to pass tool functions (speak(), listen(), etc.) to skills
- [ ] Upgrade intent matcher from phrase matching to regex then intent matching
- [X] Make skills use classes

# Rules
- Document! More > less. Better > more. ğŸ“š
- Test carefully! ğŸ¥‡
- Be creative! ğŸ’¡
